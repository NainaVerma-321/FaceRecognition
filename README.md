# FaceWatch ‚Äì Real-Time Face Detection System

FaceWatch is a real-time face detection application built using Python and OpenCV. It uses a Haar Cascade Classifier to detect human faces from a live webcam feed and highlights them with bounding boxes. The project demonstrates the use of fundamental computer vision techniques for real-time applications.
